# Data-Visualization-Netflix

Netflix Content Analysis (Data Visualization with Matplotlib)
🎨 Project Overview
This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. The goal is to understand what kind of content is available on Netflix and how it has changed over the years. By using Python and data visualization libraries, I cleaned the data and created charts to show trends in content production.

📊 Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing information (like missing directors or countries) to make the dataset accurate.

Content Comparison: A bar chart comparing the total number of Movies versus TV Shows.

Trend Analysis: A line chart showing the growth of content releases from the early years up to 2021.

Top Contributors: Identification of the most frequent directors and countries producing content for the platform.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python: The main programming language.

Pandas: Used for loading the CSV file and organizing the data into tables.

Matplotlib: Used for creating professional-looking graphs and charts.

📈 What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced:

Importing and cleaning "messy" data using dropna.

Grouping data by year and type to see historical trends.

Customizing plots with labels, titles, and legends to make them easy to read.

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.

Install the required libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib.

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells.
